# Infinite City RPG

This is a minimal example of a 3D open world game using Three.js. Walk around the city and interact with NPCs to hear some jokes. Use it as a starting point for a bigger game.

## Running

Open `src/index.html` in a modern browser. Click on the page to lock the pointer, then use WASD to move and the mouse to look around. Press `E` to talk to NPCs.
